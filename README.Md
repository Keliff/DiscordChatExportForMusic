# Discord Chat Export for Music

This script is designed to take a .json file created with the [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) by Tyrrrz

The script here goes through the different messages of the .json blob and extracts URLs and applies tag information to it. It also places different URLs into buckets, such as YouTube, Spotify, Bandcamp.
